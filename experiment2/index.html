				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I'm trying to recreate the Pyramid of Giza in the style of Jojo Bizzare Adventure with some interactive elements added.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Color: colors were inspired by Jojo Bizzare Adventure’s wacky color palette to create landscapes. </p>
				</p>Primitives: The Pyramid is created with triangle primities. </p>
			    </p>Polygons: The stars are made of multiple vertices to and connecting edges handled by a function call. </p>
				</p>Composition: Different size of stars and pseudo random positioning of the stars create a more organic image.</p>
				</p>Life: The stars in the background are made to respond to mouse movements, creating a mouse trail. This creates a more surrealist interpretation of the scene as the audience can interact with the stars playing with assumptions of distance. </p>
					
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I built the project by myself as I haven’t formed a group yet. A really interesting part of this process for me was seeing the number of projects other people have created using p5.js library. I really wanted to create simulations using the library and I hope in the future there’s a project that will let me do that for this class. The integration process took the most amount of time. I think it would’ve probably been an easy fix if I knew how file import and export works in JavaScript but I tried and I didn’t get it to work quite right. This is why I opted to reimplement the entire github project for the particle animation in p5.js. Figuring out what was causing the particles to clump on one side of the screen was challenging but it was also the most rewarding when I made the functionality work. This experiment also was a great introduction to p5.js library. This was the first time I learned a framework through hands on project building without an extensive tutorial on the framework. I would usually watch a freeCodeCamp video on something before I start using it but with p5.js I think it was intuitive enough to figure out how to do stuff as I was building. The documentation page helped out a lot too, especially because it was nicely laid out and easy to understand (not a common thing for documentation pages). </p>
