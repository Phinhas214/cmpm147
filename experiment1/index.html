				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Funny headlines in the style of Florida Man news headlines. I was curious how this trend started. My goals for audience experience is to just have a fun website to generate funny headlines.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I used glitch.com to set up the JavaScript logic for the sentence generation. 
					I created a list of filler words that included different greetings and a list of different actions. 
					Then I used a random number generator to select a random greeting and a random action from the list.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was not a tough assignment but it took me some time to get started on it because it felt more intimidating that it was. 
					I also expected this to be a class activity but it was due the night before class so I was confused about it. 
					This caused me to turn it in late but I had fun editing the CSS file to make the text generation website look a bit more presentable.
					In the future I would like to make the background a bit more interesting and add some moving bubbles to the background. I want those bubbles to move around based on the mouse position.
